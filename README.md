# constrain

A toy constraint relaxation system I'm writing to understand Sketchpad.

This project is delighted to use [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/).

## How to hack on it

Open up the code, tests, and shell in emacs windows. Then:

    > lein repl
    user=> (use 'midje.repl)
    user=> (autotest)
